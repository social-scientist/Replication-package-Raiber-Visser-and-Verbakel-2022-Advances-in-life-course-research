g) The syntax for the data analysis is for Stata. We used Stata 16.0. 
NOTE: 
We encountered a ‘precision problem’ in our data preparation (after publication). Per default is Stata 16 not precise in calculations (https://blog.stata.com/2011/06/17/precision-yet-again-part-i). We calculated weekly wages from yearly wages before the imputations and because of the precision problem our outcome variables varies each time the code is run. However, our main conclusions do not change but the coefficients might be different.
